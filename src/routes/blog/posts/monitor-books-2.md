## monitor

When learning to code to begin with I found it difficult to stay motivated making sites or apps just for the sake of learning a new skill. I found what really motivated me was trying to solve real world problems and have a site live with real users really using it.

Fortunately around this time my friend Rory was looking for a site for his new project - Monitor a publication platform for poetry, innovative writing and criticism based in Manchester. It seemed like a good fit for what I was looking for as the project initially was small - we had one book to sell, which meant I could get something up quickly and iterate towards a better website by putting into practice what I was learning. A further crucial element in this project feeling right was that Rory is an old friend of mine, we had a mutual interest in each other doing well.

### humble beginnings

I started the first version of the Monitor site before I'd even started bootcamp or written any client side Javascript.
I was keen to dig deeper on fundamental features of getting a website live - HTML, CSS and DNS/hosting.

I had taken some of the HTML and CSS courses on [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.org) and thought it would be easy enough
to throw a website up that just had a page for the
book and an 'about' page. Developing this was a dream! I was just running loading the html files straight into the browser,
This meant there was nothing between my code and what I was seeing on the screen - having a simple set up like this made it easy
