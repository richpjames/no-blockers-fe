    <!-- <p>
      I've been obsessed with the internet since the 90s and, since 2019, have
      been working as a web developer.
    </p> -->
    <p>
      On this site you'll find thoughts I'm having on the or projects i'm
      working on in the <a href="/blog">blog</a>
      or visual ideas I'm playing with in <a href="/">sketches</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am hoping that writing my ideas in a public space will allow me to
      approach problems in a different way. I hope you enjoy seeing them.
