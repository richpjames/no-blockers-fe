<h1>about</h1>

<section>
  <p>
    I've been obsessed with the internet since the 90s and, since 2019, have
    been working as a web developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    On this site you'll find thoughts I'm having on the or projects i'm working
    on in the <a href="/blog">blog</a>
    or visual ideas I'm playing with in <a href="/">sketches</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am hoping that writing my ideas in a public space will allow me to
    approach problems in a different way. I hope you enjoy seeing them.
